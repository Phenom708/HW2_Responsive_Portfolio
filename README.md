# HW2_Responsive_Portfolio

### **Objective:**

Create a responsive web application using Bootstrap to render well on all screen sizes. I was able to accomplish this without any media queries thanks to Bootstrap being very responsive on it's own. For now, this is just a basic layout, but as I grow and complete more projects, I will continue adding and updating content.
